# Farm-Management-System

Farm Management System is a role-based web application built using Java, JDBC, and MySQL to make buying and selling farm produce easier.

There are two types of users:

👨‍🌾 Farmers

Maintain a personal profile

Add new products (crops, fruits, vegetables, etc.)

Set and update prices and quantities

View and manage orders placed for their products

🛒 Buyers

Register and log in to their own account

Maintain a personal profile

Browse all available farm products

Add items to a cart and place orders

Track order status from their profile

Key Features

Separate login & registration for farmers and buyers

Product management for farmers (add/update/delete products, set price)

Product catalog for buyers with category-wise items (crops, fruits, vegetables, etc.)

Shopping cart functionality and order placement

Order tracking for buyers

Persistent storage using MySQL with JDBC connectivity

This project helped me practise DBMS concepts, relational schema design, authentication, JDBC, and basic e-commerce flow using Java.
